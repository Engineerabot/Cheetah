    <p>Chris has been watching the clock for the last 40 mins.  "Why do I even come to this class? I never get anything out of it,"  Chris wonders. "He might say something that I need to know though.  What if he asked me a question?  I have no idea what he's been talking about lately. It is dark back here, I wonder if he can even see me back here.  I should probably try to listen, or at least look like I'm listening.  If I left early I could go read the textbook and learn this stuff in half the time, that would be more helpful then just sitting here."   </p>
    <p>Chris anxiously looks at the exit door.  "It's only 20 feet away.  On the count of three I'm going to get up and walk over to it.  One, two... but if I left early, everyone would watch me walk out.  The professor would surely stop the lecture and look at me.  What if I dropped something?  That'd be terrible.  Could I sink into the floor and slither out the door Grinch style?  Is that possible?  How did the Grinch slide along the ground like that?"  Chris can feel his hands getting sweaty as his anxiousness grows.  "If I wait for the end of class, someone might try to talk to me.  Then I would have to deal with people in the hallway too.  Augh, why did I come today!?"  </p>
    <p>Finally the class ends.  The students get up and orderly leave the classroom.  Chris pretends to gather his books, and waits for the other students to file out of the classroom.  Careful not to make eye contact with anyone, he grabs his bag and makes his way to the exit.   </p>
    <p>The hallway is unusually clear as Chris tries to make his way through without getting caught up in an awkward conversation.  He notices a group of students gathered around the atrium, which creates an easy path to the doors.  Chris makes a break for it.  Unusual movement within the atrium catches Chris's eye.  Looking through the crowd, he sees the most remarkable creature.  Wham!  Chris's bag hits the ground.  With his bag, Chris drops all of his anxieties, all of his insecurities, all of concerns.  He pushes his way through the crowd of students and comes eye to eye with, what looks like, a cheetah.   </p>
    <p>The cheetah walks along the window with strength and power.  It demands complete control of its environment. Muscles flexing with every step, the spine and tail naturally moving back and forth. The long slender body ready to turn and pounce or turn and run at any moment.   It's unpredictability keeps everyone on edge, it's beauty keeps everyone entranced.  Chris follows it along the window, matching it step for step.  He is careful to keep a half step behind.  Chris admires the beauty of the body, the narrow waist, the broad chest, the black tear markings on the face, the long fur on the back of the neck.  "It's barely older than a cub," Chris whispers.  The eyes are the most powerful feature of all.  There is power and confidence deep in those eyes, power and confidence in its soul. </p>
    <p>Chris has never seen a real life cheetah before.  Why is it here?  How did it get here?  Chris didn't know and didn't care.  Looking closely, Chris notices that it is a mechanical robot.  It is really much more than a robot, it is a work of art.  It is mechanical work of art.  This intrigues Chris even more.  "Who was the artist?   The detail of the face, the smooth movement of the body, the muscle detail, it seems so complex, yet so simple.  It is more natural than robotic, more art than engineering."  Zach watches it as it walks up and down the atrium for what seems like 5 minutes.  Darkness has now set in on the atrium, making the cheetah harder to see.</p>
    <p>Looking down at his watch, Chris walks over to his bag and looks down at it.  With a deep breath, he picks up his bag, throws it over his shoulder and walks off.   Although, now with more fire in his spirit, and more power and confidence in his soul.</p>
