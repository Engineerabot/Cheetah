# README

Introducing Raza is an open source hardware and software engineering project.


## Why is this project important

We want to create inspirational experiences. We want to work where engineering meets art, perhaps more art than engineering. Creation has a way of making us and others feel good. 

## How do I get started

Thank you for considering helping us develop Introducing Raza! We can use your help! Whether you are an expert artist, expert engineer, or a beginner, we could use your help!
