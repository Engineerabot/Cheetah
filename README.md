# README

Cheetah is an open source hardware and software engineering project. We're going to make an extremely lifelike robot.


## Why is this project important

We want to inspire people through art, robotic art. We want to work where engineering meets art, perhaps more art than engineering. Creation has a way of making us and others feel good. Come along with us!


## How do I get started

Thank you for considering helping us develop Cheetah! We can use your help! Whether you are an expert artist, expert engineer, or a beginner, we could use your help!

6/19 - We're not quite ready for contributions yet. Check back soon!
