# README

Introducing Raza is an open source hardware and software engineering project.


## Why is this project important

We want to create inspirational experiences. We want to work where engineering meets art, perhaps more art than engineering. Creation has a way of making us and others feel good. 

## How do I get started

Thank you for considering helping us develop Introducing Raza! We can use your help! Whether you are an expert artist, expert engineer, or a beginner, we could use your help!

## Installation 

If you would like to help with mechanically designing Raza, then join the Mechanical Team.  Our mechanical repository is not housed within this github repository, we are using Fusion 360's build in repository.  After joining the Mechanical Team, we will grant you access to our repository.  If you would like help with Systems Engineering, then go ahead and clone this project from Github [Cheetah](https://github.com/Engineerabot/Introducing-Raza).
