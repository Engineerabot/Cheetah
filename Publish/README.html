    <p>Cheetah is an open source hardware and software engineering project. We're going to make an extremely lifelike robot.</p>
    <h2 id="why-is-this-project-important">Why is this project important</h2>
    <p>We want to inspire people through art, robotic art. We want to work where engineering meets art, perhaps more art than engineering. Creation has a way of making us and others feel good. Come along with us!</p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-get-started">How do I get started</h2>
    <p>Thank you for considering helping us develop Cheetah! We can use your help! Whether you are an expert artist, expert engineer, or a beginner, we could use your help!</p>
    <p>6/19 - We're not quite ready for contributions yet. Check back soon!</p>
